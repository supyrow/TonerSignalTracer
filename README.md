IF.  by chance it seems to short out when tactile button is pressed. make sure your ground planes are correct on both sides i.e grounds match up!

By the way..
the hole sizes for the Panel are as follows:

the large momentary button hole is 5mm
the small speaker holes are 2.4mm

all with countersunk embellishments .

Good luck!
